# Background
<!-- > Choice overload is an adverse effect of too many available choices on our decision-making ability.
> 
> We have limited cognitive resources, so having more options to consider drains our mental energy more quickly.
> 
> Less is not always a bad idea. Cutting down the menu could increase the revenue. -->

LifeMate is your ultimate health prediction app, powered by advanced machine learning technology. We understand that maintaining a healthy lifestyle can be challenging amidst busy schedules and limited access to reliable information. That's why we created LifeMate – to simplify your journey towards better health.

With LifeMate, you can effortlessly track your health metrics and receive personalized predictions. Our app currently predicts BMI and stress levels, helping you understand your body mass index and manage stress effectively. But we don't stop there – we're continuously expanding our predictive capabilities to cover a range of diseases and conditions.


# Features
Our machine learning team develop two models for each prediction consist of:
- BMI prediction using SVC (Support Vector Classifier)
- Stress level prediciton using Tensorflow Neural Network

## Usage
To try the model you can download it from the repository
you also can access the model from the google colaboratory
